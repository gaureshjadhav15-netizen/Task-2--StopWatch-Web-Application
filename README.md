⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application

This project is a simple and interactive Stopwatch Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times easily in a clean and responsive interface.

🚀 Features
▶️ Start the stopwatch to begin timing.
⏸️ Pause to temporarily stop counting.
🔁 Reset to clear the timer and start over.
🏁 Lap Functionality — record multiple lap times.
💡 Accurate time tracking using JavaScript’s timing functions.
📱 Responsive design — works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🧩 Technologies Used
HTML5 → Structures the stopwatch elements (buttons, display, etc.)
CSS3 → Adds styling, layout, and animations for an appealing UI
JavaScript (ES6) → Implements logic for timing, lap recording, and interactivity

🧠 How It Works
The stopwatch display is built using HTML <div> elements.
CSS is used to design and align the buttons and time display.
JavaScript uses the setInterval() function to update the time every 10 milliseconds.
The app provides buttons for:
Start: Begins counting time
Pause: Stops the timer without resetting
Reset: Sets the time back to 00:00:00
Lap: Records and displays the current time as a lap
